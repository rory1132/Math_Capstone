# Capstone project on matrix completion using Python

Matrix completion aims to fill in the missing entries of a given incomplete matrix 
from a small subset of its entries. Generally, matrix completion is referred to low rank 
matrix completion since high rank matrix completion is NP-hard. The matrix given need to be low rank and sparse.

This capstone attempts to resolve matrix completion of users' movie reviews by implementing different algorithms using Python.
Apart from that, the performance of different algorithms is also compared and explained.
